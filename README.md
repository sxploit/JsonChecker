# JsonChecker
A tool to check the validity of a JSON file. If it encounters a problem, it notifies you of the error, but does not show a specific line with the error. This script reads your JSON file and resaves it with clean formatting, making it easier to read. It's designed for cases where you need to verify that your JSON is properly structured
